Given two sequences:

x . . . :0 . . .

where x, y, z represent some events and :0 is the relocation event to time 0 the expected order of event execution would be

x . . . x . . . x . . . 

ad infinitum. i.e. once the sequencer reaches time t = 4 where the relocation happens it jumps to t = 0 and executes the event present there.. problem: this would send the engine into an infinite loop with the simple sequence consisting of one relocation event at time t = 0

:0 . . . . . . 

this makes sense though :D so relocation events are events that trigger additional processing by the engine..
