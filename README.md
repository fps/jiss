# Huh?

jiss - Jack Interactive Sequencer Software


# How to build?

> make

> sudo make install

# How to run?

> lua -i examples/test.lua

The -i switch causes lua to keep running after executing the script. This is what you want most of the time

Or you can also open an interactive session via

> lua

Then do some stuff:

> require "jiss"

> -- do your funky stuff here

> -- e.g. load test.lua and work with it

> require "test"

# Documentation?
